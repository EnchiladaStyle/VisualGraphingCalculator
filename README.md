# Overview

My purpose for this project was to practice programming in C++ and to demonstrate my object oriented programming skills. I was inspired by Desmos and it was a nice refresher on some interesting math concepts.

The Visual Graphing Calculator takes input from the user as an equation and then displays the equation on a graph. The compatible equations include linear, quadratic, absolute value, sin, and tangent.

# Development Environment

I mainly used visual studio code as the IDE for this project.

The program is written entirely in C++ using the SDL2 Library to create the window.

# Future Work

- Separate classes into their own files
- Use polymorphism to clean up some of the code
- Add more functions for the users to play around with.
